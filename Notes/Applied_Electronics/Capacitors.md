# Capacitors

## Theory
- A capacitor in an electrical circuit behaves as a charge storage device
- It holds the electric charge when we apply a voltage across it, and it gives up the stored charge to the circuit as when required.
- The most basic construction of a capacitor consists of two parallel conductors (usually metallic plates) seperated by a dielectric material.
-  When we connect a voltage source across the capacitor, the conductor (capacitor plate) attached to the positive terminal of the source becomes positively charged, and the conductor (capacitor plate) connected to the negative terminal of the source becomes negatively charged.

## **Types of Capacitors:**

1. Electrolytic Capacitors

- It is a ploarized capacitor whose anode or positive plate is made of a metal that froms an insulating oxide layer through [anodization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anodization)
- This oxide layer acts as the dielectric of the capacitor.
- A solid, liquid, or gel elctrolyte covers the surface of this oxide layer, serving as the cathode or negative plate of the capacitor

2. Paper Capacitors

- Also known as fixed capacitor, in which paper is used to store the energy in the form of electrical field.
- Usually used with a capacitance value of 1nF to 1uF. It stores a fixed amount of charge
- Dielectric is paper

1. Ceramic Capacitors
- Uses ceramic material as dielectric
- Small capacitance values, typically between 1nF and 1uF.
- They are not polarized, which means they may be safely connected to AC source.
- Have a great frequency response

4. Variable Capacitors
- Whenever the capacitance of a capacitor is changed based on the necessity to a certain range of values is known as a variable capacitor
- The two plates of this capacitor can be made with metals where one plate is fixed & the other one is movable.
-  The range of capacitance that is provided by the capacitor can range from 10 pF to 500 picofarads
