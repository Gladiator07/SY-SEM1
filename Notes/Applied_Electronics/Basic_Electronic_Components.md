# **RESISTORS**:
<br>
1. A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component
2. Resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines.
3. The two main characteristics of a resistor are its Resistance R, in ohms and its Power Rating, P, in Watts.
4. Power handling capacity: P = V.I
5. As temperature increases, the power handling capacity decreases. <br>

## How do Resistors work?
- If you break one open, and scratch off the outer coating of insulating paint, you might see an insulating ceramic rod running through the middle with copper wire wrapped around the outside. A resistor like this is described as wire-wound. The number of copper turns controls the resistance very precisely: the more copper turns, and the thinner the copper, the higher the resistance. In smaller-value resistors, designed for lower-power circuits, the copper winding is replaced by a spiral pattern of carbon. Resistors like this are much cheaper to make and are called carbon-film. Generally, wire-wound resistors are more precise and more stable at higher operating temperatures. <br>
  
- The working of a resistor can be explained with the similarity of water flowing through a pipe. Consider a pipe through which water is allowed to flow. If the diameter of the pipe is reduced, the water flow will be reduced. If the force of the water is increased by increasing the pressure, then the energy will be dissipated as heat. There will also be an enormous difference in pressure in the head and tail ends of the pipe. In this example, the force applied to the water is similar to the current flowing through the resistance. The pressure applied can be resembled to the voltage.

## Resistors and temperature
The resistance of a resistor isn't constant, even if it's a certain material of a fixed length and area: it steadily increases as the temperature increases. Why? The hotter a material, the more its atoms or ions jiggle about and the harder it is for electrons to wriggle through, which translates into higher electrical resistance. Broadly speaking, the resistivity of most materials increases linearly with temperature (so if you increase the temperature by 10 degrees, the resistivity increases by a certain amount, and if you increase it by another 10 degrees, the resistivity rises by the same amount again). If you cool a material, you lower its resistivity—and if you cool it to an extremely low temperature, you can sometimes make the resistivity disappear altogether, in a phenomenon known as superconductivity

## Resistor Series and Parallel
In a series connection, the resistors will be connected in a series path and the current flowing through the resistors will be the same. The voltage across the resistors will be equal to the sum of voltages across each resistor. Here is a figure of resistors connected in series. Three resistors R1, R2, and R3 are connected in series. The total resistance Rtotal is given by

Rtotal = R1 + R2 + R3 <br>

In a parallel connection, the resistors will be in a parallel path and the voltage applied across each component will be the same. The current across the resistors will be equal to the sum of currents across each resistor. The above figure shows a parallel connection of resistors. Three resistors R1, R2, and R3 are connected in parallel. The total resistance Rtotal is given by

1/Rtotal = 1/ R1 + 1/ R2 + 1/ R3.

Therefore, **Rtotal = R1 * R2 * R3 / R1 + R2 + R3**


## TYPES OF RESISTORS
<br>

### 1. **Wire-Wound Resistors**
<br>

- Resistors with ceramic rod wound up with copper wires are called wire-wound resistors.
- Have the effect of inductance as they have copper windings
- Power rating of a high power wound resistor is 500 Watts and the available resistance value of these resistors is 0.1 ohm - 100k ohms
- Makes less noise than carbon composition resistors
- Good performance in overload conditions
- Can be used with DC and Audio Frequency Range
- Costly and can't be used in high frequency equipments
<br>

### 2. **Carbon-Composition Resistors**
<br>
- Usual resistors with a resistive element in the shape of the cylinder
- Resistive material is mixture of carbon powder and ceramic. This mixture is held together with the help of resin. This mixture is held together with the help of the resin. This mixture is embedded with wire leads. This is then attached to wires made of lead. The value of the resistor can be found out by color coding. <br>

- If the concentration of carbon increases, the resistance of the component decreases.
- Overheating and overvoltage problem

### 3. **Variable Resistors**

<br>

- As the name indicates, those resistors which values can be changed through a dial, knob, and screw or manually by a proper method. In these types of resistors, there is a sliding arm, which is connected to the shaft and the value of resistance can be changed by rotating the arm. They are used in the radio receiver for volume control and tone control resistance.

- Following are the further types of variable resistors - Potentiometers, Rheostats and Trimmers


### 4. **Carbon Film Resistors**
<br>

- Carbon Film resistors contains on an insulating material rod or core made of high grade ceramic material which is called the substrate. A very thin resistive carbon layer or film overlaid around the rod. These kinds of resistors are widely used in electronic circuits because of negligible noise and wide operating range and the stability as compared to solid carbon resistors.

### 5. **Metal Film Resistors**
<br>
-Metal film resistors are same in construction like Carbon film resistors, but the main difference is that there is metal (or a mixture of the metal oxides, Nickel Chromium or mixture of metals and glass which is called metal glaze which is used as resistive film) instead of carbon. Metal film resistors are very tiny, cheap and reliable in operation. Their temperature coefficient is very low (±2 ppm/°C) and used where stability and low noise level is important.

### 6. **Surface Mount Resistors**

- A surface mount resistor is a tiny rectangular ceramic body with silver conductive edges on either end. Also referred to as surface mount technology, an SMD resistor offers advantages in saving space on printed circuit boards (PCBs).
- It features the resistance value code printed onto it, where there is space.
- Solder paste is printed onto the mounting pads of a PCB, and the resistors are placed automatically onto these pads by pick and place equipment
- The whole board is then passed through a reflow oven which melts the solder into place, making the contacts.
- A surface mount resistor provides the same functionality as the more traditional axially leaded resistors but has a lower power dissipation capacity and oftentimes a lower stray inductance and capacity.
- Surface mount resistors are used in large quantities and are the preferred resistor for use in electronics equipment, because of the small size and high reliability.
